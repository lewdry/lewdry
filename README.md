Hi, I’m **Lewis**, an undercover librarian interested in woodworking and web apps. I'm a passionate about open data, open source and cultivating the public domain.

I build small tools, data projects and web experiments that sit at the intersection of **tech, data, and thoughtful design**.  
Sometimes reflective, sometimes playful, always intentional.

I am currently whittling away on Dharawal land in NSW. 🌲 🌳 🪵
